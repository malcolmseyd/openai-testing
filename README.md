# OpenAI Testing: Lisp Interpreter

This repo is for messing around with code generated by OpenAI Codex. OpenAI is cool and I wanted to see what it could do, and fixing the bugs in the code that it produces is a good exercise. For each folder, if I've modified the code at all then I'll have an `original/` subdirectory with the unmodified code.
